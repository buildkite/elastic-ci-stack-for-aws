## Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS

[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) provides a platform for running fast, secure, and scalable continuous integration pipelines on your own infrastructure.

The Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS gives you a private, autoscaling [Buildkite Agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent) cluster. Use it to parallelize large test suites across thousands of nodes, run tests and deployments for Linux or Windows based services and apps, or run AWS ops tasks.

## Getting started

Learn more about the Elastic CI Stack for AWS and how to get started with it from the Buildkite Docs:

- [Elastic CI Stack for AWS overview](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/aws/elastic-ci-stack) page, for a summary of the stack's architecture and supported features.
- [Linux and Windows setup for the Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/aws/elastic-ci-stack/ec2-linux-and-windows/setup) page for a step-by-step guide on how to set up the Elastic CI Stack in AWS for these operating systems.

A [list of recommended resources](#recommended-reading) provides links to other pages in the Buildkite Docs for more detailed information.

[![Launch AWS Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=buildkite&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/latest/aws-stack.yml)

The current release is ![](https://img.shields.io/github/release/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws.svg). See [Releases](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws/releases) for older releases.

> Although the stack creates its own VPC by default, Buildkite highly recommends following best practices by setting up a separate development AWS account and using role switching and consolidated billing ‚Äî see the [Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts tutorial](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) for more information.

If you want to use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), download [`config.json.example`](config.json.example), rename it to `config.json`, update it with your agent token, then run the below AWS CLI command to create the AWS CloudFormation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --output text \
  --stack-name buildkite \
  --template-url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/latest/aws-stack.yml" \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND \
  --parameters "$(cat config.json)"
```

## Security

This repository hasn't been reviewed by security researchers. Therefore, exercise caution and careful thought with what credentials you make available to your builds.

Anyone with commit access to your codebase (including third-party pull-requests if you've enabled them in Buildkite) will have access to your secrets bucket files.

Also, keep in mind the EC2 HTTP metadata server is available from within builds, which means builds act with the same IAM permissions as the instance.

### Limiting CloudFormation Permissions

By default, CloudFormation will operate using the permissions granted to the identity of the credentials used to initiate a stack deployment or update.

If you want to explicitly specify which actions CloudFormation can perform on your behalf, you can either create your stack using credentials for an IAM identity with limited permissions, or provide an [AWS CloudFormation service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-servicerole.html).

üßë‚Äçüî¨ [templates/service-role.yml](templates/service-role.yml) template contains an experimental service role and set of IAM Policies that list the IAM Actions necessary to create, update, and delete a CloudFormation Stack created with the Buildkite Elastic CI Stack template. The role created by this template is currently being tested, but it has not been tested enough to be depended on. There are likely to be missing permissions for some stack parameter permutations.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file templates/service-role.yml --stack-name buildkite-elastic-ci-stack-service-role --region us-east-1 --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

## Experimental Resource Limits

The Elastic CI Stack includes configurable systemd resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion. These limits can be configured using CloudFormation parameters:

| Parameter                          | Description                                            | Default |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `ExperimentalEnableResourceLimits` | Enable systemd resource limits for the Buildkite agent | `false` |
| `ResourceLimitsMemoryHigh`         | MemoryHigh limit (e.g., '90%' or '4G')                 | `90%`   |
| `ResourceLimitsMemoryMax`          | MemoryMax limit (e.g., '90%' or '4G')                  | `90%`   |
| `ResourceLimitsMemorySwapMax`      | MemorySwapMax limit (e.g., '90%' or '4G')              | `90%`   |
| `ResourceLimitsCPUWeight`          | CPU weight (1-10000)                                   | `100`   |
| `ResourceLimitsCPUQuota`           | CPU quota (e.g., '90%')                                | `90%`   |
| `ResourceLimitsIOWeight`           | I/O weight (1-10000)                                   | `80`    |

### Example Configuration

To enable resource limits with custom values, include these parameters in your CloudFormation template or config file:

```yaml
{
  "Parameters": {
    "ExperimentalEnableResourceLimits": "true",
    "ResourceLimitsMemoryHigh": "80%",
    "ResourceLimitsMemoryMax": "85%",
    "ResourceLimitsMemorySwapMax": "90%",
    "ResourceLimitsCPUWeight": "100",
    "ResourceLimitsCPUQuota": "85%",
    "ResourceLimitsIOWeight": "75"
  }
}
```

### Notes
- Resource limits are disabled by default
- Values can be specified as percentages or absolute values (for memory-related parameters)

## Development

To get started with customizing your own stack, or contributing fixes and features:

```bash
# Checkout all submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build all AMIs and render a cloud formation template - this requires AWS credentials (in the ENV)
# to build an AMI with packer
make build

# To create a new stack on AWS using the local template
make create-stack

# You can use any of the AWS* environment variables that the aws-cli supports
AWS_PROFILE="some-profile" make create-stack

# You can also use aws-vault or similar
aws-vault exec some-profile -- make create-stack
```

If you need to build your own AMI (because you've changed something in the
`packer` directory), run packer with AWS credentials in your shell environment:

```bash
make packer
```

This will boot and image three AWS EC2 instances in your account‚Äôs `us-east-1`
default VPC:

- Linux (64-bit x86)
- Linux (64-bit Arm)
- Windows (64-bit x86)

## Support Policy

We provide support for security and bug fixes on the current major release only.

If there are any changes in the main branch since the last tagged release, we
aim to publish a new tagged release of this template at the end of each month.

### AWS Regions

Buildkite:

- Supports all AWS Regions, except China and US GovCloud.
- Aims to support new regions within one month of general availability.

### Operating Systems

Buildkite builds and deploys the following AMIs to all our supported regions:

- Amazon Linux 2023 (64-bit x86)
- Amazon Linux 2023 (64-bit Arm)
- Windows Server 2022 (64-bit x86)

### Buildkite Agent

The Elastic CI Stack template [published from the main branch](https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/latest/aws-stack.yml)
tracks the latest Buildkite Agent release.

You may wish to preview any updates to your stack from this template
[using a CloudFormation Stack Change Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html)
to decide whether to apply it.

## Questions and support

Feel free to drop an email to support@buildkite.com with questions. It'll also help us if you can provide the following details:

```bash
# List your stack parameters
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name MY_STACK_NAME \
  --query 'Stacks[].Parameters[].[ParameterKey,ParameterValue]' --output table
```

### Collect logs from CloudWatch

Provide Buildkite with logs from CloudWatch Logs:

```bash
/buildkite/elastic-stack/{instance-id}
/buildkite/system/{instance-id}
```

### Collect logs via script

An alternative method to collect the logs is to use the `log-collector` script in the `utils` folder.
The script will collect CloudWatch logs for the Instance, Lambda function, and AutoScaling activity and package them in a
zip archive which you can send via email to support@buildkite.com.
